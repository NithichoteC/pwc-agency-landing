# PWC Agency Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
AI-powered lead generation agency specializing in solar and roofing industries. Building end-to-end automation system with n8n workflows, AI agents, and real-time dashboards.

## Key Project Patterns

### Architecture Philosophy
- **AI-Augmented, Not Replaced**: Every AI decision has human oversight
- **Workflow-Driven**: n8n orchestrates all business processes visually
- **Data-Centric**: Every action measured and optimized with real-time KPIs
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add sophistication in phases

### Technology Stack Preferences
- **Orchestration**: n8n (self-hosted on Coolify/Hetzner) - visual, maintainable
- **Database**: Dual strategy - Baserow (primary) + Supabase (analytics/AI)
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS with dark mode aesthetic
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Vapi, satellite imagery analysis
- **Authentication**: Magic links for passwordless client access

### Design Language
- **Visual Theme**: Dark mode (#171717) with bronze/gold gradients

- **Key Differentiator**: Satellite imagery analysis for property pre-qualification

### Development Workflow Patterns
- **Sprint Cadence**: Weekly iterations with rapid deployment
- **Testing**: Pre-deployment test plans for each workflow
- **Version Control**: Conventional Commits with descriptive messages
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and comprehensive README files
