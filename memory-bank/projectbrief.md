# Project Brief: PWC Agency Operating System

## Project Overview
**Mission**: Transform the PWC Agency Playbook into a fully executable, AI-powered operating system for lead generation in the solar and roofing industries.

## Core Objectives
1. **Operationalize the Playbook**: Convert the comprehensive agency playbook into executable workflows, systems, and processes
2. **AI-Powered Lead Generation**: Build end-to-end automated lead generation funnels using AI agents and n8n workflows
3. **Scalable Agency Model**: Create a replicable system that can scale from 1 to 10+ clients with minimal manual intervention

## Key Requirements
- **Industry Focus**: Solar and roofing companies in developed markets
- **Technology Stack**: n8n, Baserow, Supabase, React/Tailwind, AI services (OpenAI, Vapi, etc.)
- **Core Values**: D.R.I.V.E. (Data-Backed Decisions, Relentless Iteration, Integrity in Automation, Value-Stacking, Empathy for End-Users)
- **Exclusivity Model**: One client per 15-mile radius

## Success Metrics
- **Cost per Lead (CPL)**: Target optimization
- **Conversion Rate**: >Y% (lead→appointment)
- **Show Rate**: >Z% for scheduled calls
- **Pipeline Velocity**: Lead-to-close time <14 days
- **ROI**: ≥5× client investment

## Current Status
- Playbook exists as comprehensive documentation
- Core tech stack identified and partially implemented
- Need to build executable workflows and systems
- Target: First paying client within Month 1

## Scope Boundaries
**In Scope**:
- Lead generation automation
- Client onboarding systems
- Dashboard development
- AI agent implementation
- Workflow orchestration

**Out of Scope**:
- Industries beyond solar/roofing
- Manual lead generation methods
- Complex enterprise integrations (initially)

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Founder (sole operator currently)
- **Secondary**: Future clients (solar/roofing companies)
- **Future**: Team expansion (Project Manager, AI Engineer, Designer, Copywriter, QA)
